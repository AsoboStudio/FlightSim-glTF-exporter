# How to install
Here are the steps to follow to use the installer locally.

## Copy
Copy the executable from the zip file on your local drive.

## Admin Mode
In order to use the installer, as it will have to modify files in you program files folder, you need to run the application in admin mode.

To run in administrator mode, simply right click the exe, navigate to the compatibility tab and select the run this program as an administrator checkbox.

I know this might sound scary but this is the only way we can deploy the required dll in you program files folder. In case you prefer to deploy manually, you can still find all the built libraries in the Github releases assets.

# How to use
You can now launch the tool \o/

Once launched, it will show you for both Max/Maya and their different respective versions, the currently installed exporter version.

You can then easily install the latest available version or uninstall the plugin.

## Plugin not found
If the software (3ds Max or Maya) was not automatically found, you can easily relocate the installation folder by pressing the (re)locate button. Just locate the root of the installation. At this point, the software will automatically search for the exporter.

## Quick Update
The update all button is the way to go and will install / update the exporter for all the applications found on your system at once.
